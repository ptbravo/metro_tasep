# IIQ3763 Final Project
Sets of Staircases Modeled using TASEP
Nuble Station Transfer in Metro

The aim of the script is to simulate the movement of people in a set of staircases containing normal an mechanical ones. This kind of configuration of stairs are often found on transfer between Metro lines, and studying the flux of people on different configurations is of interest of the passenger and the Metro.

The core algotihm behind the script is the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP), that has been modified to fit the phenomena of interest. 

There are 4 codes uploaded.

metro.py : Simulation for a single set of staricases.

job.sh : Script to iterate over the parameters and sample behavior of the script.

analysis.py : Plot and analyze data from said sampling.

nuble.py : Simulation for the L6-L5 Nuble staircase configuration.
